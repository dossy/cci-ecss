ecss was written at Community Connect Inc. in April 2007. It was the spiritual successor to [Switch](http://sourceforge.net/projects/switchcss), which was designed and written by Chris Garcia and David Worley the previous year, also at Community Connect. Based on feedback from nearly a dozen working designers who used Switch over that year, Daniel Cowgill redesigned and reimplemented the language as ecss.

Special thanks to:
  * Karl Llewellyn and John Merlino: for valuable feedback and insights into CSS
  * Graham Lowe: for design and implementation advice
  * Chris Garcia and David Worley: for inventing Switch, the inspiration for ecss
